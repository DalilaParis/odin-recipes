    <p>Small batch desserts are my favorite mid-week indulgence. From chocolate chip cookies to mug cakes, I love having small batch recipes on hand to make whenever a dessert craving hits but I want just a couple servings of something sweet. </p>
    <p>These small batch brownies are my latest creation, and I'm in love. I have a mug brownie recipe that takes under 5 minutes to prepare, but nothing beats a classic fudgy brownie that's been baked in the oven!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled.</li>
        <li>¾ cup granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>1 large egg.</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk.</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>⅓ cup natural unsweetened or Dutch process cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon instant espresso powder.</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spray a 9x5 loaf pan well with nonstick cooking spray, line the pan with parchment paper leaving some overhang for easy removal, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk the melted butter and sugar together until well combined. Then, whisk in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Sift in the cocoa powder, flour, instant espresso powder, and salt. Whisk until just combined.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread it around into one even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18 to 23 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean with just a few moist crumbs.</li>
